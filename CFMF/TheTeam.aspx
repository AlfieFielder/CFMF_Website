							<h3>Phoebe Duarte - Chair</h3>
                            <p>Having worked closely with Claire for her entire time at Albatross, there was no question that I would join the committee.  Claire was such a vibrant member of our team, she knew everyone, always had a smile, took the time to speak to people no matter how busy she was and was very hardworking.  I know she would be very proud of the work we do for others in her name.</p>

                            <p>The Claire Foster Memorial Fund is a great thing to be part of. I hope that I can think of original and fun fundraising event ideas or two in order to raise money for amazing charities. It is good to know that as individuals and a company we do something to help the wider local community.</p>

							<h3>Tracey Howes</h3>
                            <p>I'm part of the Claire Foster Memorial fund team because Albatross has always been a fun company to work for and I saw opportunities for us to further bond as colleagues whilst also raising money for people less fortunate than us.</p>

							<h3>Lisa Tooth</h3>
                            <p>I was asked to be a part of The Claire Foster Memorial Fund soon after joining The Albatross Group and did not hesitate in accepting.  It is great to be a part of something that is close to the hearts of staff, become involved with the team and help to raise funds in Claire’s memory for the local charities.  I look forward to supporting with new ideas and events with the same passion that is shown throughout The Albatross Group.</p>

							<h3>Sue Duffy</h3>
                            <p>I remember Claire well, a special lady. I have always supported the CFMF where I have been able to, but have previously declared that I’ve been too busy to get more involved. As life generally always seems busy, I recently got my “ducks in a row” and looked at where I can help and make a difference. For this reason I requested to join the team and they thankfully accepted my request!</p>

                            <p>I have worked for the Albatross Group for over 14 years and have enjoyed being part of many of the fund raising events organised by the CFMF. I have joined the board so I am able to further support the great work they do whilst linking opportunities with our people related events.</p>

                            <p>I really wanted to join the CFMF team to help contribute new ideas to raise money for the well worth charities. Sadly I didnt get to meet Claire personally, but colleagues that did feel extrmemely lucky to have known such a lovely lady. I hope I can bring some new ideas for such a worthy cause!</p>
